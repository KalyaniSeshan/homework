# 63canonical.py

# You probably learned that ATG is the only start codon, but is it?
# Write a program that reports the start codons from the E. coli genome
# Your program must:
#    1. read GCF_000005845.2_ASM584v2_genomic.gbff.gz at the only input
#    2. use a regex to find CDS coordinates
#    3. count how many different start codons there are

# Note: the sequence is at the end of the file
# Note: genes on the negative strand are marked complement(a..b)

# Hint: you can read a file twice, first to get the DNA, then the CDS
# Hint: check your CDS by examining the source protein
