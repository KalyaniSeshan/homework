# 32xcoverage.py

# Write a program that simulates a shotgun resequencing project
# How uniformly do the reads "pile up" on a chromosome?
# How much of that depends on sequencing depth?

# Report min, max, and average coverage
# Make variables for genome size, read number, read length
# Input values from the command line

# Hint: make the problem smaller, so it's easier to visualize and debug
# Hint: if you don't understand the context of the problem, ask for help
# Hint: if you are undersampling the ends, do something about it

# Note: you will not get exactly the same results as the command line below
