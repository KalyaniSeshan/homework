# Your party has just defeated an evil dragon and it's your time to pick loot.
# You can either have the ring of fire protection, which gives advantage on
# all fire saving throws, or the cloak of fire protection, which gives +3
# versus all fire saving throws. Which one is better? Make a program that
# simulates saving throw success at various DCs (1-20) for ring and cloak.
