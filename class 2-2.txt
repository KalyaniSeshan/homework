"""


shotgun sequencing: when randomly sequencing and aligning seq back to genome,
 the seqs start to pile up twice as much on a duplicated sequence than a normal
 sequence in the chromosome
 coverage: amount of reads aligned on a specific part of chromosome (how many 
 reads overlap a specific position, or pile up on a location)
 - resequencing genome
 - endpoints are unreliable to check coverage bc they have a low chance of being
 sampled (undersampled)
 - look in middle for average coverage etc. (just leave out ends)
 - with 100x coverage in middle, can never get 1 or 0 coverage at ends
